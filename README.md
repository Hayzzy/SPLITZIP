# SPLITZIP
A program that automatically takes a PDF file of larger sizes (say 100+pages), splits it and adds it into a folder then zips it and that zip folder can be used to give to various multiple sources like AI, different OCR software, etc. The program can then also extract the text using Tesseract and fork it to a .JSON file which can be further used.
